# Docker Deliberate Practice

The goal of this deliberate practice block is to introduce you to Docker as a tool to enhance the local dev experience when working with third-party services as well as increase parity between local dev and production. Each exercise will work against services that have already been bootstrapped for you.

Please make your own branch e.g. `dp/sean-neal` and push your progress regularly.
